# Homework-0

This is an introductory homework. The idea is to complete the steps as listed below and then two python notebook that show the work done. Please refer to the following instructions in this work:

1. [Obtain AWS academy access](https://github.com/vu-topics-in-big-data-2022/instructions/blob/main/aws/student_aws_academy_learner_lab_guide.pdf). You should have received an email for that. If not, then reach out to instructors immediately.
2. [Read the overview of google colab and colab with github](https://github.com/vu-topics-in-big-data-2022/instructions/blob/main/colab/readme.md).
3. [Read the pdf that shows how to collect the link saying open in colab for the notebook](./CorrectingTheLinksInPythonNotebook.pdf) and open the [Assignment_0.ipynb](./Assignment_0.ipynb) in google colab and correct the link.
4. Run the steps listed in [Assignment_0.ipynb](./Assignment_0.ipynb) and save it back to github.
5. Read https://towardsdatascience.com/connecting-google-colab-to-an-amazon-ec2-instance-b61be9f9cf30
6. Run Assignment_0 notebook on AWS using the instructions from step 5 and save it as Assignment_0-aws.ipynb in your repository.
8. Submit the link of your repository that was created by github classroom in the brightspace as the submission to the assignment. This last step is critical. Without this your work is not considered submitted.
